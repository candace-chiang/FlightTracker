# FlightTracker
MDB project 4!

Have you ever missed a flight? If so, make sure to clone this spanking fresh git repository and stay tuned! This project allows you to check out the status of your flight as well as browse the many airports Lufthansa services. In it, you're able to see the paths of your flights, its estimated and (if available) actual departure/arrival times, and favorite the ones you like most â€” it's essentially your one-stop shop for flights. It makes use of a REST API and some pretty fancy Maps (and of course my extraordinary coding skills), so make sure to check it out!
